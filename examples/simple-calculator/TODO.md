# TODO

## Critical (Must Have)

- [ ] Create calculator.py with basic structure
- [ ] Implement addition operation
- [ ] Implement subtraction operation
- [ ] Implement multiplication operation
- [ ] Implement division operation
- [ ] Add error handling for division by zero
- [ ] Add input validation for numbers
