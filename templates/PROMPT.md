# PROMPT.md

## Task
Build [WHAT YOU'RE BUILDING].

Read clarify-session.md for full requirements.

## Instructions

1. Read TODO.md for current tasks
2. Pick the highest priority incomplete task
3. Read any files before editing them
4. Implement the task completely
5. Run tests (if applicable)
6. If tests fail, fix before continuing
7. Mark the task complete in TODO.md
8. Commit your changes with a clear message
9. Repeat steps 1-8 until all tasks are done

## Signs (Guardrails)

These are important rules to follow:

- **Always read before editing**: Never edit a file without reading it first
- **Never skip failing tests**: Fix tests before moving to the next task
- **Don't refactor unrelated code**: Stay focused on the current task
- **Keep commits focused**: Each commit should complete one logical task
- **Update TODO.md immediately**: Mark tasks done right after completing them
- **Check your work**: Verify the implementation matches requirements

## Completion Criteria

When TODO.md shows all tasks are complete and tests pass (if applicable), output:

**DONE**

This signals the end of the execution loop.
